# Welcome to the webpage of Groupoid C*-algebras!

In the upcoming 2022 fall semester, we will be running a seminar on Groupoids and C*-algebras. 

We will follow the text book ___A Tool Kit for Groupoid C*-algebras___ in the first couple of talks and then turn to related topics including but not limited to semigroups, graphs, foliations, and twisted groupoids. More detailed information will be updated later.
